Silence is golden
Silence is still golden
Silence was golden yesterday
Silence is golden today
Silence will be golden tomorrow
Silence is golden, isn't it Google
Silence is golden this Friday
Isn't silence golden today
Things are beginning to be less silent
Nah, silence is golden once again
Not so silent anymore, is it
Why is everything so loud
I think I have tinnitus
